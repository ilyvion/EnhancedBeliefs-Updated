## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2025-08-11

### Added

- When a religious book is destroyed, the mood debuff that is applied to followers of the affected ideology now has an icon showing which ideologyâ€™s book was lost. (NOTE: This is a temporary feature while we add proper book burning precepts in an upcoming version.)

### Changed

- The "Iconoclast" mental break has been completely reworked. Pawns experiencing this state will now actively seek out religious books and attempt to burn them, rather than simply destroying ones reachable outside containers directly. Book burning is now a visible, multi-step process: pawns will place the book on the ground and attempt to ignite it, making the act more immersive and dramatic.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-08-09

### Fixed

- Error in translation string invocation.
- Removed accidentally left in debug logging.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-08-09

### Added

- Added job fail reasons to the 'complete religious book' work giver so you get an explanation why a given pawn can't do the work to complete the book.

### Changed

- Moved ideoligion opinion information into its own pawn tab.
- The finishing a book job is now much improved; there's an effecter active while the book is being written, providing sound and visual effects and the book is now placed onto the lectern to be worked on.
- Replaced hard-coded English text with translatable text.

### Fixed

- Add a null checks for when calculating a pawn's mood.
- When Royalty was active, base-game patches were not applied due to accidental filename clobbering.
- Bug with being able to access the correct defs.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-08

### Fixed

- Conversion ability now actually causes reduction in certainty on targeted pawn.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-08-04

### Changed

- Changed back to original packageId for better future compatibility with original.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-04

### Added

- Update mod to work on RimWorld 1.6.

### Changed

- Project layout changed to match how ilyvion works.
